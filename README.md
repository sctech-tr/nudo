# nudo
## normal user do
this script always runs commands as a normal user, even if you are root.

i had this idea for a while. you can use it now!

try to ```sudo nudo sudo nudo echo i am a normal user!```
## how do i use it?
```
nudo <command>
```
## how do i install it?
```
git clone https://github.com/sctech-tr/nudo.git
cd nudo
sudo make install
```
